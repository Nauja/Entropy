# Entropy - Coding Standard

Language agnostic coding standard and static code analysis tool.

## Introduction

**There must exist universal coding guidelines reflecting how nature works.**

Entropy is a coding standard aimed to help you writing code easier to understand, maintain and unit test.

It works by defining a set of simple rules that encourage you to write code that tend to mimic how
nature works. The main idea is that it should reflect the fact that nature is
composed of a multitude of independent systems having little responsibilities rather than
a single system with a lot.
